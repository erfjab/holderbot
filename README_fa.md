# How to use the bot? # 

All explanations are complete and clear, but if you still notice any deficiencies or shortcomings in the explanations, please create an issue, and we will address it. Thank you for your cooperation.

> [!WARNING]
> These tutorials are exclusively for version 4. Previous versions are no longer supported.

## 🏛 Home Page

about the homepage, you'll find all the necessary commands listed, with detailed explanations provided further down the page. Here, besides entering commands, you can also send the username or link of your subscription. If the user exists, you'll receive their statistics, and if they don't , with Holder Bot's search feature to receive a list of similar users.

When user statistics are sent to you, you'll see three options: "Update," "Qrcode," and "Delete." To update the user's statistics, use the "Update" button. To receive the barcode for the user's subscription link, use the "Barcode" button. And to delete the user, use the "Delete" button. 

> [!NOTE]
> Don't worry, before carrying out the deletion operation, you will be asked for confirmation.

## 🚀 Create User

You have two options for creating a user: either through templates or manually. You can create ready-made templates by referring to the 'templates' section in this tutorial and creating your templates. When creating a user, if you click on one of your templates, the inbounds, volume, and time are pre-selected, and you will be asked for your username and the desired number. The bot automatically numbers the usernames and creates the users.

If you want to do this manually, you will be asked for inbounds, volume, and time, which is more suitable for specific cases. Templates speed up your work and allow you to create hundreds of users in a fraction of a second.

## 🎖 Notice

Welcome to the Messages section! This feature has been added with sponsorship the [Gray](https://t.me/GrayServer) collection.❤️ You can visit the Gray collection channel and bot for purchasing servers on an hourly and monthly basis, with a wide variety of locations and specifications, accompanied by clean IPs at the lowest prices. Before activating the Notice, you need to create an inbound Shadowsocks with the name "Holderbot" inside the panel:

```
{
  "tag": "Holderbot",
  "listen": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 2222,
  "protocol": "shadowsocks",
  "settings": {
    "clients": [],
    "network": "tcp,udp"
  }
}
```
Then, inside the host settings of the inbound, we put our desired messages. After applying the changes, inside the Holderbot, we click on the "Change Status" option in the Notice section, and this feature becomes active. Holderbot checks users every 5 seconds and activates the messages for completed users, notifying you accordingly.

## 👤 Users

In the Users section, you receive general statistics of your panel. The number of users "all," "activated," "disabled," "on_hold," "limited," and "expired," along with the count of users who were online or offline in the last 24 hours, and whether their links have been updated or not, are provided.

Below, you'll find options where clicking on them will provide you with a list of user names in PDF format. If you click on the last two options, you'll be prompted for your desired timeframe, and based on that, you'll receive the statistics.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a specific timeframe in mind, you can enter it based on the pattern 'time min/hour/day'.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Admins

You can fully manage the panel admins in this section. You can add admins, remove admins, change admin passwords, and modify admin permissions. Just note that for removing sudo admins, it can only be done from the master server using the CLI command. APIs do not allow us access to this capability.

## 🎗 Nodes

You can also manage your servers here, reconnect, deactivate, activate, or set the consumption coefficient for your desired server. For monitoring and receiving server disconnection notifications, refer to the monitoring section on this page.

## 🗃 Templates

By creating templates, you can easily manage repetitive tasks, such as specifying volume, duration, and inbounds. In the templates section, you can create a new template or delete existing ones. To create a new template, simply click on "➕ Add new template." In the first step, enter the name without spaces, numbers, or icons. Then enter the volume (in gigabytes) and duration (in days), and finally select the inbounds. Each selected inbound marked with ➕ is included, while those marked with ➖ are not. After completing your selection, click "✅ finish" to save the template. To delete a template, simply click on it, and you'll be asked for confirmation. Once confirmed, it will be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> You add/remove templates in this section, but you only use them in the "🚀 Create User" section.

## 🎛 Monitoring

Monitoring for your servers is enabled by default during the installation of HolderBot. You can enable/disable it from this section. You can also set the server check interval for monitoring and specify the waiting time for the next check when receiving a server disconnection notification.

## 🔍 Search

Sometimes you may not remember the username completely but want to input a few letters for the bot to find it easily and tell you. Is this what you mean? This capability is specifically designed for searches of this nature, where the bot can list the usernames similar to your input and send them to you.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is not for receiving user statistics. For that purpose, you can refer to the homepage tutorial.

## 💬 Help

A guide on solving problems, requesting assistance, reporting bugs, contacting the developer, and similar matters will be sent to you. Additionally, a file containing Holder Bot logs will be sent to you, which you can share with the developer if needed for debugging and problem-solving.

## 🖼 QR Code

You can receive its barcode by sending any link or text. This feature is not exclusive to v2ray links, and it can provide you with its barcode in code form for any received link. It's quick and simple!

> [!TIP]
> You can modify the barcode color in the "qr.py" file in the "Function" folder using line 8 (fill_color) with options like red, pink, blue, yellow.
